# Strengthening Participatory Democracy


Nowadays, in Greece, there is a vast amount of data which arise from the draft laws public consultation. This type of consultation allows citizens to express their views, suggestions, arguments, or disagreements which are associated with the ongoing legislation. However, the current consultation system and its infrastructure discourage citizens from participating and, moreover, it does not offer policy analysts and shapers the necessary tools to take full advantage of citizens’ participation. Furthermore, there is no direct way to determine the impact of the consultation on drafting the final law.

If you are using intellij you may have to go to  Tools > File watchers and add Babel. In the watcher setting add a new scope with the pattern
file[root]:public/js/*.jsx
If you do not do this, Babel also parses the .js files since the file type is "Javascript" (there is no JSX file type in intellij)
Make sure you specify the file type that the watcher will “watch” for you and run the program.
If you use some custom file extension, e.g. .es6 or .jsx, check that it’s associated with JavaScript file type in Preferences | Editor | File types
